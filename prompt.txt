I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML","number":"6","start":601.0,"end":603.0,"text":" Suppose you write what is SEO."},{"title":"SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML","number":"6","start":58.0,"end":60.0,"text":" First of all, I want to tell you what is SEO?"},{"title":"SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML","number":"6","start":604.0,"end":605.0,"text":" You have written what is SEO."},{"title":"SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML","number":"6","start":60.0,"end":63.0,"text":" SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization."},{"title":"SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML","number":"6","start":608.0,"end":610.0,"text":" SEO stands for this in simple terms."}]
---------------------------------
"what is seo"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
