You're looking for an explanation on "what is SEO". So, SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It's a process of improving the visibility and ranking of a website in search engine results pages (SERPs) through various techniques.

In our Sigma web development course, we'll be covering SEO in more detail later on, but if you want to get started with the basics now, I'd recommend checking out video 6 of our course. The relevant timestamps are around 58-63 seconds and 601-610 seconds.

At those points, you'll see how SEO is defined and explained in simpler terms. Our instructor will dive deeper into the concept, so if you want to learn more about SEO, make sure to watch that video.
