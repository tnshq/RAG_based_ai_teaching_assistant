SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. If you see any website, then SEO is there in it. Let's take the example of Amazon.in. I opened Amazon.in, so Amazon.in wants this website to be loaded as soon as possible. So that their products can come in search. Google is a search engine. Google's responsibility is to show the best pages to the users. So Google wants to show only those pages that are fast, Present information very well, And along with that, there are some things in them that the user has a good experience. For example, let's say there are two pages. One page has told about dog food. The other page has also told about dog food exactly the same time. But the page 2 of these two is loaded very fast. It loads well, so Google will give it more preference. Along with that, there are core web vitals that Google considers to rank two pages. First of all, content is important. What is on your page? If your content is good, then your website can rank without core web vitals. But if you are competing with a page that has presented almost similar quality content, Then your core web vitals will be seen. And if your core web vitals are good, then you will be given preference. So the first thing that comes in the core web vitals is your CLS. You see this video here, which I have run from the web.dev website. You will see that someone comes to your website and he is trying to cancel the order here. And by mistake, the time he canceled, this thing above became visible. And he shifted the layout and the order was completed. But the user wanted the order to be incomplete, he wanted to click on no. In this case, the user experience is very bad. And as you saw in this video, it should not be like this. That's why our CLS should be as low as possible. Now what is the definition of CLS? Cumulative layout shift means how much is shifting while the page is loading. Suppose you have loaded the page and first of all you get to see this. This was above and then when this key term part was loaded, then everything was shifted below. The layout should not be shifted. If you put width and height in images, then the layout will not shift. The next metric we are going to talk about is LCP. And LCP stands for Largest Contextual Paint. This means that if the user is viewing a page, then the biggest element on it. For example, the biggest part in this is this image. How long is it loading? Means the whole page will be loaded, but the biggest element which is the most important, How long is it loading? According to web.dev and google, a good LCP score should be 2.5 seconds. That is, the biggest element of the page should be loaded in 2.5 seconds. After this comes the third metric which is FID. Which stands for First Input Delay. First Input Delay means that if any user has clicked on any input element, Like on a button or any type of input on a page, So how long does that input process? For example, if you click on a button, then how long does that button click browser process? And according to google and web.dev, your input should start processing in less than 100 milliseconds. So these were the three core web vitals which are very important. For your information, these core web vitals are also updated. But these three are very important and you should know. Now I will show you what is the lighthouse report and why do they generate? And how will these three core web vitals get value from there? So I tell you here, if you inspect by right-clicking, And you may be coming to the right side, You can bring it down by right-clicking. If you want, you can bring it here again and bring it down by right-clicking. I prefer it down because I am used to looking down from the starting. Now you are getting the option of lighthouse here. Lighthouse basically generates a report for you and tells you what can be improved in your HTML page. For example, if I want to see how mobile users see my website, Then I will click on mobile or I will click on desktop, I will close this tab. I will click on mobile and click on analyze page load. So this will generate a report for me. You can see that a report has been generated here. Performance, accessibility, best practices, SE and PWA are being shown. Now you can see that some things are shown in red here. That is, there is a scope of improvement in the page. Now you are telling that size your images properly. Your website can be loaded fast 2.7 seconds. So all these suggestions are given to you by lighthouse. And if you incorporate these suggestions, then your website will be loaded very well. And will give a good experience to the user. Now you can see that it is written here that image elements do not have explicit width and height. So you should give width and height. The width and height attribute of the image that we read in the last video should be used. So that it is reserved in your browser. When we set width and height in HTML, then it is reserved in the space browser. Otherwise, if we do not set height and width, then what will happen is that Our browser will not know how much space to reserve. And as long as the CSS is loaded, the whole page will shift from the bottom. So we do not want our page to shift during loading time. If our page starts shifting, then if we are going to click here. So when it is accidentally shifted, it may happen that we click here. Suppose there was an image coming here, I am going to click here. And as long as I clicked, this image was loaded during that time. And all this content shifted down. And instead of clicking here by mistake, I will click on the image. This is called cumulative layout shift. So this kind of shift is not preferred at all. Google does not prefer it at all. And this should be as low as possible. You can see that the space is very low. So we have to keep the cumulative layout shift as low as possible. So that our user can get a very good experience. So here are many more suggestions. And this is for our mobile. Now we can generate a desktop report. So the desktop report will be generated. So as you can see that it has generated a report. 92 marks in performance. 100 out of 82 in accessibility. 75 in best practices and 75 in SEO. Now you see here that the things that are good are told here. And the scope of improvement that is there, it is told to you. So this is a hidden tool that we should all use. Now I want to tell you about meta tags and meta description. So what I will do here is that I will make a new file. I will name it index.html. And after making an HTML file, the first SEO element I want to tell you is title. If your title is reflecting the content of your page, then this is a very good SEO practice. Whenever your page is changing, you make the title in such a way that it reflects the content of your page. Because if you want your website on Google, then it will come according to the title. Google's index is like you guys write code with Harry here. Okay, and if you write like this, then this thing is the title of the page. And this is the title of the page that YouTube has put. This title is of the page that Instagram has put. This title is of the page that GitHub has put. So if the title is on the page and the title actually reflects the content of your page. Then your website will rank very well. Now let's say I put content here and I put an h1 and write Harry here. And after that, let's say I write a paragraph here and write lorem 45 here. Now why did I write lorem 45? I will do view word wrap. Why did I write 45? This is a very good question. I wrote 45 because I am lazy and 4 and 5 are around. So I reduced 4 and 5. I also write 23 because they are also around. Okay, so there is no other reason. Now I will preview it quickly here. I will open in browser here. So see it looks like this. Now this document is written. If I leave it like this, then it will not be a good SEO practice. I will write about Harry here and I will write code with Harry here. Which is also my website. Okay, and what will happen by doing this? That my title will reflect here. As you can see. So what will happen by doing this kind of work? That my website will have more chances of being seen in Google. I will inspect and also take out its lighthouse report. And I will see what are the scope of improvements. Now its lighthouse report will be very big. Because there is nothing in it that I should improve. But when I will put images, then I will get suggestions. Like put width, put height. Along with that, I will tell you one more trick. So that you can see your website in any mobile. You will find out. So you guys click here. Can you see the computer here? Click on it. And after that if you choose responsive in it. So you can see that how your website will be seen in any kind of device. So you can see if your website is responsive or not. If you go to see in a specific device. Like in iPhone 12 Pro. Your website will look like this in iPhone 12 Pro resolution. Now don't say why there is no 15 or 16 in it. 12 Pro means a big iPhone device. Understand. In such a big device. How will your website look in such a big device? This is simply being told to you. So now you can see here. How will it look in Surface Pro 7? By clicking here. How will it look in Google phones? You can also find out. And if you want to take a general view. That my website is in a responsive device. In any kind of device. Suppose how will it look in iPad? Now if you don't have a device here. Then you choose responsive. And find out the approximate width of your device. In total, your website should look good in all the width devices. How does this happen? I will tell you later in this course. Now if you click here again. Then it stops. This responsive view stops. And as soon as it stops. Your website looks like this. I will close it. I will come back here. Now I will tell you about Meta Text. Here I will write like Meta. Then you will see Meta DESC is coming here. I will click on Meta DESC. And here I can give the description of my page. Suppose I give. This is the page. This is a page about. This is a page which contains description about Harry. And here you can write whatever page content you have. Whatever you want. Like I show you. Suppose you write what is SEO. You have written what is SEO. See here. This page has put this Meta Description. SEO stands for this in simple terms. Now it is not necessary that a search engine will parse your Meta DESC. It will not do this. If it liked it. Then it will parse and keep your Meta DESC here. If you have not put Meta DESC. Then Meta DESC can be generated from your content. So this is the responsibility of the search engine. What will Bing do? What will Google do? We do not know this. But from our side. Our page should be absolutely to the point. Especially if we are writing a blog. And we want our page to rank organically. So here you can see. I have put Meta DESC. Now a Meta Keyword used to work a lot earlier. But now the Meta Keyword. That has been deprecated. Meta Keyword is not used at all now. The code of Meta Keywords looks like this. But it is believed that. Meta Keywords. They do not rank at all in SEO. Because people abuse it more. Suppose you have written a page. About pets. And you have written what is SEO in Meta Keyword. So it is not that your page will be ranked. I will correct these double quotes here. So if I put Meta Keyword here. It is not necessary that the search engine will consider it. Some search engines do this. They do not believe in Meta Keywords. They say that we do not want to see your Meta Keywords. You do not put it. So Meta Keywords used to work a lot earlier. But now it does not work. Now the content of your page is being parsed. And now the time of AI is coming. So especially more. Your content will be understood. What value is your content giving. It will be understood. Accordingly it will be ranked. Now if you want to know exactly. About these Core Web Vitals. For example. If I right click and inspect. And go to Lighthouse. And for the desktop. I take out the Lighthouse report. So some Core Web Vitals come. Like LCP comes. Then after that. FCP comes. First Contextual Paint. Now you can see here. Everything is 100. Look here. There was not much in this content. But here you can see. What is he saying. What are you doing. Pages with Websocket. Cannot enter. Back Forward Cache. It has Websocket. Because we are using this extension. Live Preview. Otherwise this is absolutely right. Accessibility is also 100. Everything is 100. This is a very good page. PWA is Progressive Web Apps. Which we will not make now. But you see here. First Contextual Paint. Largest Contextual Paint. Total Blocking Time. Cumulative Layout Shift. Speed Index. If you want to know about all this. Like what is First Contextual Paint. What is the user going to see. How long has it been painted on the browser. So if you want to see this. Then you have to go to web.dev. Web.dev is a very good website. Which talks about all these things. And you can see here. That he keeps talking about it. You can learn here. About all these things. What is it? If you want to learn PWA. You can learn PWA. About all these things. Here. A lot of good content. So you can see here. This is the content. This is the content. This is the content. This is the content. All these things. Here. A lot of good content. But we are in this course. HTML. CSS. JavaScript. And we will focus on making websites. This thing should have come to you. Because of which. I told you about it. If you have not yet. Sigma Web Development Series. Have not accessed. So definitely access it. Access the playlist. Bookmark it. Click here. On the star. And click here. And save it. That's all for this video. Thank you so much. For watching this video. And I will see you. Next time."
